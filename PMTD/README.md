PMTD, a simple Tower Defense Game
=================================

The game is in a very very early stage atm so its
lacking most of the stuff that makes a game enjoyable.
So its basically my personal tinkering project so far but
I hope to see it grow into an actual game over time.

Press 't' to spawn a tower at cursor's current position.
Press 'c' to start a creep wave.
Press 'p' to pause and 'r' to resume.
